# SocialDistancing
Social distancing is one proven way of preventing the mass spread of the Corona Virus(COVID19). 
This pure javascript application demonstrates the importance of social distancing in the COVID19 pandemic.

Explanation
-----------
The white nodes represent healthy people. The black nodes represent infected/sick people. 
The demonstration starts with one black node. Initially, it doesn't seem like a threat.
